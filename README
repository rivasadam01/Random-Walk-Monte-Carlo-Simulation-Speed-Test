Random Walk & Monte Carlo Simulation Speed Test

I was learning about Threading and Multiprocessing programming and I was using time.sleep
to simulate long calculations. I came  across a youtube video:

The explained the random walk & monte carlo simulation in python. So I wanted to see
the speed difference running the same simulation in  single and multicore processes.

The simulation will run 20,000 walks.
For each walk it will walk up to 30 blocks.
Then it will calculate the percentage if a transport is needed or not.

The program will give you a menu to chose which version of the simulation to use.
Single or multiprocess
